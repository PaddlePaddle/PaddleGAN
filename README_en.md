Features:

- Highly Flexible:

  Components are designed to be modular. Model architectures, as well as data
preprocess pipelines, can be easily customized with simple configuration
changes.

- Rich applications:

  PaddleGAN provides rich of applications, such as image generation, image restore, image colorization, video interpolate, makeup shifter.

## Install

Please refer to [install](./docs/en_US/install.md).

## Quick Start

Get started through ppgan.app interface:

 ```python
 from ppgan.apps import RealSRPredictor
 sr = RealSRPredictor()
 sr.run("docs/imgs/monarch.png")
 ```
