# This is an example config file.  Note that # is used to create a comment.

# At its most basic level a config file is just a bunch of key/value pairs.
# So for example:
key1 = value2
dlib = a C++ library

# You can also define "sub blocks" in your config files like so
user1 
{ 
    # Inside a sub block you can list more key/value pairs.  
    id = 42
    name = davis

    # you can also nest sub-blocks as deep as you want
    details 
    { 
        editor = vim
        home_dir = /home/davis
    }
}
user2 { 
    id = 1234
    name = joe
    details { 
        editor = emacs
        home_dir = /home/joe
    }
}
